# WARNING!! THE DEVELOPMENT ON THIS PROJECT HAS SADLY STOPPED. THIS IS DUE TO DISCORD STAFF GOING DOWN ON SELFBOT USAGE MORE AND MORE OVER THE PAST MONTHS AND I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT THE IDEA OF RUNNING A SELFBOT!

_**This decision has been made in part for my own accounts safety as well as yours. Please do not take this decision the wrong way as I have no ill intentions with it. I really deeply do not like having to make this decision but it simply has to be done. For those who used Discord-Self-Bot primarily for Rich Presences I can strongly recommend you to check out JustDotJS' [SimplePresence](https://github.com/justdotJS/SimplePresence) application**_

**Support will still be given but know that I will not make any changes to fix bugs. The Issue tracker has been removed as none will be fixed.**

## Many features that were in the selfbot are also in my public server bot, Ribbon. Ribbon is still going to get fully supported as I hope it continue to grow. If you would like to invite Ribbon to your server you [can click here](https://discord.now.sh/376520643862331396?p8)
